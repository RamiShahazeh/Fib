# fibonacci

I recently watched a youtube video about finding the x1, x2 for this equation:

which has two soltions:

but in the same time we can use those two solutions to find out the nth sequence
of fibonacci using calculus in a really fast way using this equation:

if you run the program you can see the time difference in values like 30 and above
