# fibonacci

I recently watched a youtube video about finding the x1, x2 for this equation:
# X^2 - X - 1 = 0

which has two soltions but in the same time we can use those two solutions to find out the nth sequence
of fibonacci using calculus in a really fast way using this equation:

# nth fib seq = 1/sqrt(5) * [ ((1 + sqrt(5) )/2)^n - ((1 - sqrt(5) )/2)^n]

if you run the program you can see the time difference in values like 30 and above
